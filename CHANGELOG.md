          Almost Vanilla turns off all of these patches:
              - open the Fairy Water shop in Breconnary    
              - have the old man take the Token along with Staff & Stones
              - move the Golem encounter to Charlock
              - make sure all forced encounters are never marked defeated
              - changes the enemies summoned by the harp.
              - sets the encounter rate of Zone 0 to be the same as other zones.
              - set Death Necklace chance to 100%
              - adjust MP requirements
              - adjust enemy HP values (notable for Golem and Dragonlord)
              - buff the HEAL spell
              - buff the HURT spell
              - lock the stat build modifier at 3
              - replace 7-13 GOLD chests with 500-755
          Additionally, when "Almost Vanilla" is on: 
              - GOLD chests are only updated to 500-755 if chests are shuffled
              - the "Random Map" flag is disabled

This should help with progression to level 2 as well.

Other stuff...

* Random enemies in Charlock are now limited to Werewolf and above for ultra mode (it was too easy).

###### Pre-release - Released Dec 28, 2015 ######
